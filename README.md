# HR Analytics Project
Every year 15% of the employees of XYZ company leave the organization and hence are required to be replaced 
with the talent pool available in the job market. The management believes that this level of attrition 
(employees leaving, either on their own or because they got fired) is bad for the company because of the 
following reasons: 
1. Former employee's project gets delayed. 
2. A sizable department has to be maintained for the purpose of recruiting new talent. 
3. New employees have to be trained for a job(which is again cost to the company).

Business Objective:
Build a model using Logistic Regression to find the probability of attrition.
Also, we need to understand what factors should be focused on by the management in order to curb attrition.
In other words, we need to find those variables which affect employee attrition and should be focused right away by tha management.
